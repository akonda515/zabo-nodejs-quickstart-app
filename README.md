What is Zabo? A unified cryptocurrency API.
=========================
[Zabo](https://zabo.com) is an API for connecting with cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets and protocols like Bitcoin. Instead of manually integrating with [Coinbase API](https://zabo.com/integrations/coinbase), [Binance API](https://zabo.com/integrations/binance), [Bitcoin APIs](https://zabo.com/integrations/bitcoin) or the hundreds of other cryptocurrency APIs - you can simply use Zabo for them all.  

We believe teams and developers should focus on building great products, not worry about the fragmented landscape of exchange APIs and blockchain protocols.  

For our updated list of integrations, [check out our Zabo integrations](https://zabo.com/integrations).
