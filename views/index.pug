  p Welcome to the Zabo Quickstart App!<br/>
    | First let's connect a wallet by clicking the connect button below
  button.connect-btn Connect

  main#after-connect(hidden)
    h2 You did it! A wallet was connected ðŸŽ‰
    p Letâ€™s explore some of the API requests you can make with Zabo and the type of data it offers:

    section
      a(href='https://zabo.com/docs/#get-a-specific-balance' target='_blank')
        h3 Balances ðŸ”—
        small Zabo.users.getBalances(...)

      p By calling <b>Zabo.users.getBalances(...)</b> we can return the native balances (e.g. 0.5 BTC) of a wallet connection. <br/>
        | Here are the balances for the wallets you have connected:

      table
        thead
          tr
            th Wallet
            th Currency
            th Balance
            th Updated At
        tbody#balances

    section
      a(href='https://zabo.com/docs/#create-a-user' target='_blank')
        h3 User accounts ðŸ”—
        small Zabo.users.create(...)

      p We also created a new user by calling <b>Zabo.users.create(...)</b> and attached the connected account.<br/>
        | This user now has the following accounts connected:
list
command button.connect-btn "Connected Accounts" 
open list
list var= Account Values 
if button(disabled)
val var = "ERROR"
Message "YOU have an Error Please read the following."
code "NO Accounts Linked"
message "Please Link an account or wallet with Zabo."
list end
END

          tr
            th(colspan=2) Wallet
            th Account ID
        tbody#accounts
 if value=value in auth then accept 
 else deny
 button.connect-btn "Add Account!"
      p Would you like to try connecting another account?
      button.connect-btn Attach another account

    section
      a(href='https://zabo.com/docs/#get-transaction-history' target='_blank')
        h3 Transactions ðŸ”—
        small Zabo.transactions.getList(...)

      p By supplying <b>Zabo.transactions.getList(...)</b> we can return the transaction history of a given wallet connection. <br/>
        | Here are the transactions for the account you just connected:

      table
        thead
          tr
            th Transaction ID
            th Type
            th Parts
            th Status
            th Date
        tbody#transactions
